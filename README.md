# NABOPB

This repository provides the Python implementation of the **NABOPB algorithm** from the paper:  
**"Nonlinear approximation in bounded orthonormal product bases"**  
by Lutz K√§mmerer, Daniel Potts, and Fabian Taubert.

## üìÅ Contents

- *NABOPB.py*: Main implementation of the NABOPB algorithm.
- *NABOPB_subroutines.py*: Supporting subroutines required by the main algorithm.
- *demo.py*: A collection of demo examples demonstrating the use of the NABOPB algorithm.  
  ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: For quick tests, use small parameters (e.g., sparsity `s` and extension `Gamma.N`), or comment out unnecessary demo calls.
- *r1lfft/*, *mr1lfft/*, *cmr1lfft/*: Python implementations for generating rank-1 lattices and performing fast transforms on them. These implementations are based on original MATLAB code by Lutz K√§mmerer.
